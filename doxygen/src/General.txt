<b>CMSIS-Pack</b> describes a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board
support. The XML-based package description (PDSC) file describes the content of a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack"
(file collection) that includes:
 -  Source code, header files, and software libraries
 -  Documentation and source code templates
 -  Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms
 -  Example projects

The complete file collection along with the PDSC file is shipped in ZIP-format (renamed to *.pack). The PDSC file is designed
for software development environments and describes the user and device relevant context for the files supplied within such
a pack file.

The CMSIS-Pack system solves several problems:

- It provides meta-data of files that relate to a software component. All files that belong to a software component can be
  identified and information about the original provider is preserved.
- It enables consistent software component upgrade and identifies incompatible configuration files that may be part of the
  user application.
- Software component providers can specify the interfaces and relationship to other software components.
- The meta-data of a software component can include dependency information for toolchains, devices, and processors which
  simplifies the integration into application programs.

After installing a \ref cp_SWComponents "Software Pack", all included software components are available to the development
tools. \ref cp_Components "Software components" are a collection of source modules, header and configuration files as well as
libraries. Packs containing software components can also include \ref cp_Examples and \ref cp_CodeTemplates.

The \subpage pack_revisionHistory lists the main changes between versions.


\section SWPackVariants Software Pack Use Cases

A pack can be used to deliver:

- \b Device \b support: a so called <i>Device Family Pack (DFP)</i> contains CMSIS system/startup files, drivers, and flash
  algorithms for a microcontroller device family.
- \b Board \b support: a <i>Board Support Pack (BSP)</i> contains documentation, schematics, and drivers for a certain
  development board.
- \b Middleware: distribute software components belonging to a middleware stack (such as source code or libraries) in
  CMSIS-Pack format.
- \b In-house \b software: distribute software components within a company or engineering group.

\note
- A Software Pack can address multiple use cases at the same time!
- CMSIS itself is distributed as a software pack (containing the generic CMSIS components (CORE, DSP Library, and RTOS
  implementation)) and is supplied by Arm.

The following sections provide more information:

 - In the \ref cp_Packs, learn the basics and the required steps for creating a pack.
 - \ref cp_PackTutorial are available that show how to start a \ref cp_SWComponents "software pack" from scratch, how to
   enable device support in a \ref createPack_DFP "Device Support Pack (DFP)", and how to describe development boards in a
   \ref createPackBoard "Board Support Pack (BSP)".
 - Learn how to \ref createPackPublish.
 - \ref createPackUtil are available that are useful during the creation of a pack.
 - \ref packFormat describes all XML elements that can be used in a package description file.
 - \ref configWizard can be used to create GUI-like elements in development tools for configuration files.
 - \ref flashAlgorithm algorithms are used to erase or download applications to Flash devices.
 - \ref coresight_setup allows to create tool-agnostic debug and trace configurations.
 - \ref packIndexFile are used to generate a catalog of available packs.
